MediaTek DVFSRC

The Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling Resource Collector (DVFSRC) is a
HW module which is used to collect all the requests from both software and
hardware and turn into the decision of minimum operating voltage and minimum
DRAM frequency to fulfill those requests.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following
	- "mediatek,mt8183-dvfsrc": For MT8183 SoC
- reg: Address range of the DVFSRC unit
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
	"dvfsrc": DVFSRC module clock
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.

Example:

	dvfsrc@10012000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-dvfsrc";
		reg = <0 0x10012000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_DVFSRC>;
		clock-names = "dvfsrc";
	};
