title: DMA-BUF Heaps Memory Manager binding

description: |
  DMA-BUF heaps is a memory manager that allows for sharing of buffers between
  pdifferen trocesses and between user space and kernel space. DMA-BUF heaps
  manages different memory spaces by separating the memory spaces into heaps.

  All child nodes of a qcom,dma-heaps node are interpreted as DMA-BUF heap
  configurations for CMA and secure carveout heaps.

          Specifies the reserved memory region that this heap will allocate
          memory from. This property is only required for heaps that draw memory
          from a particular reserved memory region. Refer to
          Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt
          for more information.
