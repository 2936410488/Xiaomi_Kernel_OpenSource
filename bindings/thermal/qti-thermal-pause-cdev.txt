QTI CPU pause cooling devices.

The CPU pause cooling device will be used for isolating a CPU on a thermal
condition. This cooling device driver can register one cooling device per
signle or multiple CPUs, which can be used by thermal zone to mitigate.

Each child node will represent a cooling device and the child node should
point to the CPU mask, which will be mitigated by that cooling device instance.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,thermal-pause"

Cooling device node:
- qcom,mask:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: integer to indicate the mask of CPUs that this cooling
	                device will mitigate. e.g. cpu 0 (0x01) through 7 (0x80)

-#cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
			identifier. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details.
Example:
	qcom,thermal-pause {
		compatible = "qcom,thermal-pause";

		/* pause a single cpu, cpu 0 */
		thermal_pause01: thermal-pause01 {
			qcom,mask = <0x01>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};

		/* pause a group of cpus, cpus 0-3 */
		thermal_pause0F: thermal-pause0F {
			qcom,mask = <0x0F>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};

		/* pause a group of cpus, cpus 6-7 */
		thermal_pauseC0: thermal-pauseC0 {
			qcom,mask = <0xC0>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};

		/* pause a single cpu, cpu 7 */
		thermal_pause80: cpu3_isolate: cpu3-isolate {
			qcom,cpu = <&CPU3>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};
        };
