	  Scheduler optimizations for heterogeneous platforms.
	  Attempts to introspectively select task affinity to optimize power
	  and performance. Basic support for multiple (>2) cpu types is in place,
	  but it has only been tested with two types of cpus.
	  There is currently no support for migration of task groups, hence
	  !SCHED_AUTOGROUP.
