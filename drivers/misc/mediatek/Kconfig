	bool "MTK FPGA EARLY PORTING"
	help
	  Used for FPGA early porting to separate code segments between FPGA
	  platform and non-FPGA platform.
	  Say Y here if you are doing FPGA early porting.

	help
	  MediaTek A/B system updates support.
	  Partitions which need OTA update have both A and B partition.
	  Y means this kernel enabled OTA A/B system updates feature.
	  If you are not sure about this, set n

	  Y means to enable system-as-root.
	  This option merges ramdisk into system image
	  All new launched projects in android P should enable it.

	help
	  An internal debug kernel config for testing large memory mode.
	  To test if kernel drivers are fully compatible to large
	  memorys, we replace all GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE/GFP_USER pages by
	  DMA (<= 4GB) pages. It makes all drivers have more chances
	  to allocate >= 4GB physical memory.

	  In order to avoid misusing the DMA_MASK, an auto-check detection
	  is hooked in kernel to check whether the DMA_MASK value is correct.
	  This config can only be enabled for platforms which support Large DRAM.
	  Must not be enabled for those platforms which only support 4GB DRAM.

config MTK_ENG_BUILD
	bool "flag for MTK eng/usr build verification"
	help
	  Y means this kernel version is engineering mode and has more debugging
	  features built-in. This option is supposed to specifiy engineering or
