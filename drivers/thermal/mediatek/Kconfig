config MTK_SOC_THERMAL
	tristate "Temperature sensor driver for mediatek SoCs"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on NVMEM
	depends on RESET_CONTROLLER
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to get SoC temperature
	  information for Mediatek platforms. This driver
	  configures thermal controllers to collect temperature
	  via AUXADC interface.

        help
          Enable this option if you want to get SoC temperature
          information for Mediatek platforms. This driver
          configures LVTS thermal controllers to collect temperatures
          via ASIF interface.

	tristate "PMIC thermal sensor driver for Mediatek SoCs"
	depends on MT635X_EFUSE
	depends on MEDIATEK_MT635X_AUXADC
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to get PMIC temperature
	  for Mediatek platforms.
	  This driver reads the voltage value from PMIC AUXADC channels,
	  and converts raw value to PMIC temperature via PMIC efuse data.

config MTK_MD_THERMAL
	tristate "Mediatek Modem cooling framework"
	depends on MTK_ECCCI_DRIVER
	help
	  Enable this option to turn on modem throttle mechanisms
	  for Mediatek platforms.
	  This option depends on MTK_ECCCI_DRIVER which is the
	  IPC interface between AP SoC and modem.

config MTK_THERMAL_TRACE
	tristate "Mediatek thermal ftrace driver"
	depends on FTRACE
	depends on NET
	help
	  Enable this option if you want use ftrace for thermal
	  driver debugging on Mediatek platforms.
	  This driver creates trace points and a periodical timer
	  for network throughput calculation.

config MTK_THERMAL_IPI
	tristate "Mediatek thermal IPI interface driver"
	depends on MTK_TINYSYS_SSPM_SUPPORT || MTK_TINYSYS_MCUPM_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to use and communicate
	  with tinysys microprocessors for Mediatek platforms.
	  This driver defines thermal ipi commands and provides an
	  API to send a ipi command to tinysys microprocessors.
